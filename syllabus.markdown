The Data Mining course for graduate students, is focused on learning skills necessary for generating insights from data to aid business decision making. This is a hands on course with a focus on teaching technical skills for converting raw data into useful insights. Students will learn how to ingest, prep, visualize and mine data using the popular open source data science tool - R. Applications of data mining techniques in business functions will be illustrated. A computer is required for this course. No prior programming experience is assumed.

## Text Books
Much of the material we cover in the course is available in these two online textbooks:
* [Grolemund, Garrett, and Wickham, Hadley. R for data science, 1st Edition, O’Reilly Media](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
* [Irizarry, Rafael, Introduction to Data Science, 1st Edition, Chapman and Hall/CRC](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/)

In addition to these you may come across a large variety of free books and resources available on the web. No text book purchase is required for this course. Any required readings will be referenced through the course as needed.

## Workflow
Work will consist of tutorials, videos, hands on labs and exercises. There will be a heavy emphasis on learning by doing. Task lists for each week will be laid out in detail.
### Datacamp
Hands on Labs will be available on Datacamp, an online platform for data science tutorials and exercises.
Datacamp labs are guided tutorials with hints to aid the learning process. Students will be provided access to this platform as part of this class. They do NOT need to pay for the platform.

## Evaluation of work
Given the limited time and the expanse of the subject, we will not use up classes for exams. Instead, your evaluation will depend upon completion of labs and assignments, that will be assigned each week. Students can attempt the labs as many times as needed. Pass/fail scores will be assigned based on on-time completion of these labs. In addition to labs, exercises and quizzes will be assigned at appropriate points in the course.

## Industry Application (optional)
Students interested in applying data mining to specific projects in their work place are welcome to approach Prof. Sharma directly. He has over a decade of industry experience before joining academia and students in previous terms have availed of this option. This is available as a purely optional component, and will not affect course grading in any way.
